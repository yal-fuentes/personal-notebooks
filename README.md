# Personal-notebooks

This project contains personal notebooks with data exploration, analysis and machine learning models.

The contents and tools may vary. They depend on my personal interests and areas of study.

# Getting started

The project is organised in different folders depending on the environment setup. Each folder also contains guidelines to recreate the environment in your local machine and be able to run the notebooks with minimal hassle.

# How to contribute

This project is mainly intended for my personal exploration. If you want to suggest corrections, feel free to create a new issue or to contribute directly creating a new branch.
